About RailsCasts

RailsCasts is produced by Ryan Bates (rbates on Twitter and ryanb on GitHub). 
A free episode will be released on the first Monday of each month featuring 
tips and tricks with Ruby on Rails. The screencasts are short and focus on 
one technique so you can quickly move on to applying it to your own project.
The topics target the intermediate Rails developer, but beginners and experts
will get something out of it as well. A Pro option is also available containing
more screencasts each week.
